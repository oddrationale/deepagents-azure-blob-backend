    Five authentication methods are supported (mutually exclusive):

    1. **Connection string** — set ``connection_string``. Other fields
       (``account_url``, credentials) are ignored when a connection string is used.
    2. **Account key** — set ``account_url`` + ``account_key``.
    3. **SAS token** — set ``account_url`` + ``sas_token``.
    4. **Credential object** — set ``account_url`` + ``credential`` (any
       Azure credential instance, e.g. ``ClientSecretCredential``).
    5. **Default (AAD)** — set ``account_url`` only. Uses
       ``DefaultAzureCredential`` automatically.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If more than one credential source is provided, or if
            ``account_url`` is missing when required.
